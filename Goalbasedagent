# Goal-Based Vacuum Cleaner Agent 

This is a simple Python simulation of a **Goal-Based Agent** that moves in a grid environment and cleans all dirty cells.

The agent:
- Finds the nearest dirty cell (goal)
- Moves step-by-step to reach it
- Cleans the cell
- Repeats until the grid is clean

The simulation shows the agentâ€™s movement and cleaning in a graphical window using **Tkinter**.
